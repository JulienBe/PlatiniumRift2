/**
 * Created by julien on 3/12/16.
 *
 * The game is played on a continent that is shaped using hexagonal zones.
 * Links between zones are provided at the start of a game as a graph.
 *
 * When the game starts, all zones are neutral.
 * Platinum-beds are located on a given number of zones.
 * They produce 1 to 6 bars of Platinum per game round.
 * Taking ownership of zones allow you to win more Platinum and get more PODs.
 * You get ownership of a neutral zone by placing or moving a POD on it.
 * Your goal is to conquer the enemy HQ using PODs.
 *
 * Due to an intense fog, units can only see the Platinum and units located on tiles adjacent to or under themselves.
 * The general layout of the map will however be given: the fog will only affect Platinum and enemy PODs.
 *
 * The HQ of both players is always visible, which will let you detect the enemy base on the very first turn.
